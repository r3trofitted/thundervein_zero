# Represents the board game.
#
# This is a very basic, temporary implementation. The actual board will have more than
# 4 zones, and its serialization/deserialization will probably be handed off to a 
# specific class (maybe using +ActiveRecord::Attributes+).
#
# Eventually, the Board class should also cover the _adjacency_ of zones.
#
# In the meantime, this is enough to start working on more exploratory stuff, 
# such as giving orders by e-mail and resolving conflits.
