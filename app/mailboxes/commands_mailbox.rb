##
# Handles the command-related incoming emails
#
# At the moment, a "command" is basically the equivalent of a +create+ action on applicable resources, such as 
# +Order+ or +Participation+. (Commands involving other actions, such as +destroy+, could possibly be introduced 
# in the future.)
#
# This mailbox's is responsible for several things:
#
# - Identify the resource to be created (this is currently done by analysing the mail's subject).
# - Build the new resource from the information available in the email. (This should eventually involve some kind of NLP.)
# - Attempt to save the new resource.
# - If the resource *cannot* be saved, send a notification (via a bounce email).
#
# Do note that if the resource *is* saved (in other words, if the command succeeds), the mailbox does nothing. 
# Confirmations/positive feedback are under the responsibility of the resources themselves.
