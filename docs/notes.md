# Notes

*   When should a turn end? Once everyone has sent orders? Should the system impose a 
    time limit to avoid abuses or stalling games?
*   Since players will be sending emails to different people, including the game itself 
    (to give orders), there should be a easy way to chose the right recipient, and more 
    importantly, some kind of safeguard to avoid sending something sensible to the wrong 
    person (e.g. sending actual game orders to a player).
*   AR encrypted attributes could/should be used for the players' actual email address.
*   [ ] Implement a way to know when a player is eliminated from a game (e.g. strike their name on the monitoring page)
